Application
_________________

The system is designed for geolinked photography of objects and territories.

**Fields of application**

Obtained data can be used for:

* orthophoto creation with scale of 1:500 — 1:2000;
* 3D terrain modeling;
* altitude map generation; 
* volumetric calculations for quarries and fills;
* infrastructural objects examine;
* forest and fields mapping;
* damage control and emergency response (floods, earthquakes, wildfires).

Maintenance 
__________________

Examine the UAV for any damage after each flight.

In case of propeller blades or fin damages, you can easily replace them yourself, using spare blades.

In case of UAV body or any system damage it is necessary to contact `Geoscan support`_

.. _Geoscan support: https://www.geoscan.aero/en/support

After every 80 flights it is recommended to send the UAV to the manufacturer for check and service. 


Storage
_______________

Geoscan 201 is stored with battery apart in transport case. The launcher is to be stored in its own bag. The storage place should be dry with temperature from +5 to 25 °С and relative humidity no more then 80% with no condensate. UAV service life — 2 years.

Battery should be stored in dry cool place with no direct sunlight at temperatures from +5 to 25 °С and relative humidity no more then 80% with no condensate. Optimal temperature from +5 to 10 °С. Optimal storage charge level should be close to 19 V (see **Charger and Battery** section for details).
Battery service life — 1 year.
